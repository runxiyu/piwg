Gender-inclusive language acknowledges and respects **all** gender
identities. It additionally promotes equality and helps reduce harmful
biases and stereotypes.

-   Use vocabulary inclusive of all genders when possible.

    | Avoid                | Use               |
    |----------------------|-------------------|
    | Chairman             | Chair/Chairperson |
    | Girls and boys       | Students, etc.    |
    | Sisters and brothers | Siblings          |
    | {Boy, Girl}-friend   | Loved one         |

    In general, avoid making gender assumptions.

-   Respect people's pronouns. Ask for pronouns if unsure. Include your
    own pronouns when introducing yourself.

    The following is a table of common pronouns.

     | Association | Nominative | Accusative | Prenomial | Postnomial | Reflexive |
     |-------------|------------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
     |  Inclusive  |    They    |    Them    |    Their  |    Theirs  | Themself  |
     |  Feminine   |    She     |    Her     |     Her   |     Hers   |  Herself  |
     |  Masculine  |     He     |    Him     |     His   |      His   |  Himself  |

    Note that the "Association" column represents traditional gender
    association of the pronoun set. People who use particular pronouns
    may or may not fall into these traditionally-associated genders.

    Specially, "they/them" is not a gender association, it may be used
    generically. The use of "they/them" when referring to a singular
    person is quite common in contemperory English.

    When referring to a placeholder entity (e.g. "someone left their
    laptop here") or a person whose pronouns you do not know, either
    avoid pronouns altogether, or use gender-inclusive pronouns.

-   The bottom line

    Do not use words that represent LGBTQIA+ identities, or for that
    matter, any word that represents a minority or other group, in
    insulting or derogatory ways. Saying that something is "gay" or
    "homosexual" to express hatred towards said entity shows profound
    disrespect for minorities that have been historically disadvantaged.
    The argument to "take this easy as these are just jokes" is
    ridiculous. The mere act of descriptive terms for a specific social
    group being used as a "joke" undermines the seriousness of the
    social issue---it is worth finding something else to joke about.
