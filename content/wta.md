| FTM (female-to-male) | Please only use this when referring to classifications of gender-affirming care. See [sex-change operation](#schop) for reasons. When referring to a person's gender, use "transgender man" instead. |
| MTF (male-to-female) | Please only use this when referring to classifications of gender-affirming care. See [sex-change operation](#schop) for reasons. When referring to a person's gender, use "transgender woman" instead. |
| Preferred name/pronouns | In general, this expression should be avoided unless a person accepts multiple sets of pronouns and prefers one set in particular circumstances. |
| <span id="schop" />Sex-change operation | Not all transgender people have surgery. Most who do have surgery see themselves as affirming their gender rather than changing it. "Gender-affirming surgery" is preferred. |
| Transgendered | "Transgender" is not a verb, it's an adjective. This is grammatically similiar to someone being "femaled" or "maled".  |
