title: A Brief Introduction to LGBTQ+ Concepts
---

LGBTQ+ is an acronym that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer. In recent years, the acronym has been expanded to include intersex (I), asexual (A), and two-spirited (2S) people. It is important to note that LGBTQ+ is an umbrella term that requires frequent expansion to represent the full spectrum of queer identities, and that new terms are constantly emerging to better embody the full diversity of the queer community.

**Lesbian**

Refers to women who are attracted to other women. 

**Gay**

Conventionally refers to men who are attracted to other men. However, the term has evolved in recent years to include all same-gender-loving people.

**Bisexual**

Refers to people who are attracted to more than one gender.

**Transgender**

Refers to people whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex. “Trans woman” refers to a person who identifies as a woman but was assigned male at birth; “trans man” refers to a person who identifies as a man but was assigned female at birth; “non-binary” refers to a person who does not identify as male or female.

**Queer**

Historically, “queer” has been used as a slur, or derogatory term for people who deviate from traditional gender roles or sexual expectations. However, the word has been reclaimed by gay activists in the 1960s and the 1970s in protest marches to be a more neutral term. Today, the most common usage of “queer” is as an affirmatory umbrella term for non-heterosexual, non-cisgender, and non-label-conforming people.

**Intersex**

Refers to people who are born with sex characteristics that do not fit traditional notions of female or male bodies.

**Asexual**

Refers to people who do not experience sexual attraction.

**Two-spirited**

Refers to Native and indigenous people who occupy traditional third-gender or non-gender-conforming roles in cultural and ethnic ceremonies. These roles vary substantially in different Native cultures. The term was devised by queer people in Native communities to differentiate from non-Native, mainstream queer identities, but has seen wider usage in recent years.

**The “+”**

Whilst we have labels for people to use as they see fit, sexuality and gender are a spectrum and people often find their preferences vary over time. The “+” is designed to include anyone who would prefer not to attach a specific label to their sexuality and/or gender identity.

The intersex-inclusive progress flag is a symbol of the LGBTQ+ community. The flag was remodeled after the original rainbow flag, which features six horizontal stripes of colors. The brown and black stripes have been added to represent people of color in the LGBTQ+ community, while the blue, pink and white stripes represent transgender and gender non-conforming people. The purple circle embedded inside the yellow field represents intersex people. These stripes are designed to be arrow-shaped to symbolize the progress towards inclusivity and diversity.
