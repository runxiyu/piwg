Inclusive Language Guide: LGBTQ+

LGBTQ+ is an acronym that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer. In recent years, the acronym has been expanded to include intersex (I), asexual (A), and two-spirited (2S) people. It is important to note that LGBTQ+ is an umbrella term that requires frequent expansion to represent the full spectrum of queer identities, and that new terms are constantly emerging to better embody the full diversity of the queer community.

## Lesbian

Refers to women who are attracted to other women. The term can also be used by non-binary individuals.

## Gay

Conventionally refers to men who are attracted to other men. However, the term has evolved in recent years to include same-gender-loving people of all genders.

## Bisexual

Refers to individuals who are attracted to more than one gender.

## Transgender

Refers to individuals whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex. “Trans woman” refers to an individual who identifies as a woman but was assigned male at birth; “trans man” refers to an individual who identifies as a man but was assigned female at birth; “non-binary” refers to an individual who does not identify as male or female. 

### Note:

- An individual does not have to undergo gender-affirming surgery or healthcare in order to identify as transgender.
- Whether to undergo gender-affirming care and treatment is a highly personal and significant decision that takes a variety of factors into account (socio-economic, psychological, physical). 

### Gender dysphoria

Refers to psychological and mental distress induced by a difference between an individual’s sex assigned at birth and their gender identity. However, not all transgender/non-binary individuals experience gender dysphoria. 

### Gender-affirming care

Refers to a supportive form of healthcare that provides medical, surgical, mental health, and non-medical services to transgender and non-binary people. Gender-affirming care aims to improve the general well-being of transgender and non-binary people and mitigate the effects of gender dysphoria. Not all transgender and non-binary people undergo gender-affirming care.

## Non-binary

Refers to individuals who identify as neither female nor male. While non-binary has conventionally been categorized under the transgender umbrella, different non-binary people differ as to whether they identify as transgender. 

## Queer

Historically, “queer” has been used as a slur, or derogatory term for individuals who deviate from traditional gender roles or sexual expectations. However, the word has been reclaimed by gay activists in the 1960s and the 1970s in protest marches to be a more neutral term. Today, the most common usage of “queer” is as an affirmatory umbrella term for non-heterosexual, non-cisgender, and non-label-conforming individuals.

## Intersex

Refers to individuals who are born with sex characteristics that do not fit traditional notions of female or male bodies.

## Asexual

Refers to individuals who do not experience sexual attraction. 

## Two-spirited

Refers to Native individuals who occupy traditional third-gender or non-gender-conforming roles in cultural and ethnic ceremonies. These roles vary substantially in different Native cultures. The term was devised by queer individuals in Native communities to differentiate from non-Native, mainstream queer identities, but has seen wider usage in recent years.

## The “+”

Whilst we have labels for people to use as they see fit, sexuality and gender are a spectrum and people often find their preferences vary over time. The “+” is designed to include anyone who would prefer not to attach a specific label to their sexuality and/or gender identity.

The intersex-inclusive progress flag is a symbol of the LGBTQ+ community. The flag was remodeled after the original rainbow flag, which features six horizontal stripes of colors. The brown and black stripes have been added to represent people of color in the LGBTQ+ community, while the blue, pink, and white stripes represent transgender and gender non-conforming people. The purple circle embedded inside the yellow field represents intersex people. These stripes are designed to be arrow-shaped to symbolize the social progress towards inclusivity and diversity.
