title: About the PIWG
---

 The Pao Inclusiveness Working Group is a student-led working group at [YK Pao School](https://ykpaoschool.cn/). We aim to fight against racism, sexism, homophobia, tranphobia, and other forms of discrimination and bigotry, on campus and beyond.

[Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic or discriminatory behaviour is prohibited as severe infractions in our school's Behavior Policy](../school-policies/behavior-policy/#no-discrim), but is nevertheless prevalent, especially in younger year groups.
